# Immunofluorescent staining of olfactory epithelium cryosections

The purpose of this protocol is to detect individual proteins via
indirect immunostaining for light microscopy. This protocol uses
traditional cryosectioned samples. For staining of olfactory epithelium
with expansion microscopy and more detailed descriptions of dissection
procedures, see github.com/katieching/Protocols. This method may differ
slightly from what I've published previously (DOI:
10.1371/journal.pbio.3000852). Both methods should work with the same
antibodies, but this one will likely yield better signal to noise.

## Procedure

### Sample Preparation

1.  Perform mechanical dissection of the olfactory epithelium. Samples
    usually produce cleaner staining if this is done in cold Tyrode's
    buffer, but keep in mind that dynamic microtubules may be lost if
    samples aren't fixed promptly.

2.  Fix samples in 4% PFA in PBS for 3 hours to overnight.

3.  Wash five times in PBS. Optional: incubate in PBS overnight to
    remove residual PFA.

4.  Cryoprotect samples by removing PBS and replacing with 30% sucrose.
    Incubate samples in sucrose at 4°C at least overnight. Samples often
    contain calcified bone and may not float when sucrose is initially
    added, as softer tissue samples often do. Hence, sinking isn't a
    good indication of equilibration to the sucrose solution. Note:
    samples can be stored in sucrose for days to weeks at 4°C, but sticking to 1-2 days in sucrose yields consistently low background in my hands.

5.  Embed samples in OCT on dry ice, blotting briefly on a Kim wipe to
    remove excess liquid before submerging the sample in OCT. Note: this
    can be done at -20°C, but it takes longer. Also, samples can be
    stored at -80°C in frozen blocks for weeks, possibly longer when sealed with
    desiccant.

6.  Section samples onto charged slides using a cryostat. I typically
    take 14 µm sections because this is large enough to contain many
    whole cells, but it's too thick to image through. Thinner sections
    (8 µm) also yield nice images, but often cut off parts of cells and
    are more difficult to handle. Thicker sections (20 µm) may have more
    out-of-focus light when imaging.

7.  Store sections in slide mailers with desiccant that have been sealed
    with Parafilm and sealed into airtight bags containing desiccant.
    Keep samples at -80°C. Do not allow water to condense and then
    freeze onto the slides, as this will make for poor signal to noise
    over time. Additionally, avoid excessive freeze/thaw cycles. Stored
    properly, samples can be used months to years after sectioning.

### Preparing Slides for Staining

1.  Thaw slides by taking the bag containing samples out of the freezer
    and allowing it to warm up on the bench. Once the slide mailer is
    warm enough that condensation won't form on it, cut open the bag and
    unseal the slide mailer. Take out the slides you'll be using.
    Re-seal any slides you won't be using, adding fresh desiccant as
    needed, record the freeze/thaw on the mailer, seal into the bag
    again, and return bag to the freezer.

2.  Use a Pap pen to draw a hydrophobic border around the sections. Make
    these borders far enough away that a razor blade can be used to
    remove them later, but close enough that only a small amount of
    antibody solution will be necessary.

3.  Allow the border to dry for approximately 10 minutes.

4.  Rehydrate samples and quench any residual free aldehydes (which
    produce background) by adding PBS-SGT to each section. Incubate in a
    humid chamber at room temperature for 30 minutes. Note: if you're
    working with primary antibodies that require pretreatments, it's
    usually best to apply them right before this step, wash as needed,
    and then proceed with PBS-SGT.

5.  Aspirate PBS-SGT from slides and replace with PBS-ST to finish
    blocking and permeabilizing. Incubate in humid chamber for at least
    30 minutes. Note: slides can be stored in PBS-ST for longer if
    needed. If it will be a few hours, keep the chamber at 4°C instead
    of room temperature.

6.  During the incubations of previous steps, dilute antibodies to the
    desired concentration in PBS-ST. Keep antibodies on ice while
    waiting.

### Stain Samples

1.  Aspirate PBS-ST and replace with primary antibody mixture. Incubate
    in humid chamber for a minimum of 1 hour. Many antibodies yield
    better signal to noise if incubated longer (e.g. 3 hours), and a few
    require overnight incubation at 4°C (e.g. the anti-NeuroD1
    antibody).

2.  Wash each section three times with PBS by aspirating and then adding
    PBS with a dropper pipette. Note: more forceful pipettes may wash
    sections off the slide. Optional: incubate final wash for 5 minutes.

3.  Aspirate PBS and replace with secondary antibody mixture. Incubate
    in humid chamber at room temperature for 1 hour.

4.  Wash each section three times with PBS, as before.

5.  Aspirate PBS and replace with DAPI solution. I use a 1:1000 dilution
    in either PBS or PBS-ST.

6.  Incubate for 5 minutes in humid chamber at room temperature for 5
    minutes. During this incubation, prepare your razor blade, a Kim
    wipe, MOWIOL, coverslips, and forceps. Have an additional foil-lined
    lid or other opaque covering available.

7.  Wash each section three times in PBS, as before. Note: slides can be
    kept in PBS at this step for a few minutes, as needed.

8.  With each slide:

    a.  Use a razor blade to gently scrape off the Pap pen border from
        around the sections. Some of the PBS may leave the area, but the
        section should not be left completely dry.

    b.  Once all sections on a slide have Pap pen removed, aspirate away
        any remaining PBS. If lots of PBS is left around the section,
        use the corner of a Kim wipe to blot it away without touching
        the section.

    c.  Add a drop of MOWIOL to each section. The amount will vary based
        on the size of the coverslip, but approximately 5-10 µl per
        section is a good estimate.

    d.  Use forceps to place a coverslip over your sample. This can be a
        single round coverslip for each section or one large coverslip
        to cover all sections at once. I choose based on how far apart
        my sections are, keeping in mind that the larger coverslip will
        require more MOWIOL and take longer to solidify. If needed,
        lightly tap the coverslip to coax air bubbles away from the
        sections.

    e.  Place slide under foil lid and proceed with any additional
        slides.

9.  Optional: seal coverslips with nail polish. This technique is often
    used when folks don't want to wait for the MOWIOL to dry. I usually
    do this, regardless of when I'll be imaging, because the thick layer
    of MOWIOL, which also might contain some residual PBS that prevents
    it from hardening fully, can be a bit squishy when imaging, making
    it harder to get samples in focus and making the coverslip a little
    less firmly attached. Nail polish prevents these problems.

10. Allow MOWIOL (and nail polish) to set at room temperature, usually
    overnight. After that, slides can be stored at 4°C to preserve the
    staining, though I recommend letting slides warm up to room
    temperature if they'll be imaged after cold storage.

11. Optional: use a back-light or glancing light to make the sections on
    your slide visible to the naked eye. Use a permanent marker on the
    back of the slide (not the coverslip) to draw a circle around your
    section. This can make it easier to line up the objective on your
    sample when imaging later.
