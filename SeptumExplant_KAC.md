Septum Explant Isolation and Culture Technique

This procedure describes how to isolate the olfactory epithelium from
the septum of a mouse and grow it in vitro. The goal is to create an in
vitro system that recapitulates OSN differentiation and the associated
centriole processes as we have observed it in situ. The dissection in
this protocol is largely based on this protocol
(https://www.jove.com/v/52299/whole-mount-labeling-of-cilia-in-the-main-olfactory-system-of-mice)
by Oberland and Neuhaus, JoVE 2014. It would be best to watch their
video before attempting this protocol. Media formulation was based on Farbman 1977. Also see my experiment "OE dev
\#11" for an assessment of different growth media.

**Procedure**

Preparation

1.  Make and warm media to 33°C (or at least room temperature, can be
    pre-made and just warmed on the dissection day).

2.  Make and chill Tyrode's solution to 0 - 8°C (can be pre-made,
    filtered, and stored in fridge).

Snout Removal

\*Note: The following steps, from euthanasia through plating are best
done in less than 90 minutes for good sample quality.

1.  Euthanize mouse by CO2 or other approved method.

2.  Spray face and scruff with ethanol. Optional: If you might need to
    do any kind of genotyping for these samples later, now is a good
    time to cut and store a small sample, e.g. from the ear.

3.  Optional: Pin the limbs to the dissection surface to keep tension
    while dissecting from the head.

4.  Remove fur from the head:

    a.  Use forceps to lift fur at the back of the neck and use medium
        scissors to cut through the skin at the back of the neck,
        perpendicular to the spine.

    b.  Use forceps to lift the skin on the back of the skull and use
        medium scissors to cut through the skin of the face, from the
        incision at the neck to the tip of the snout.

    c.  Lift the skin on one half of the face and brace your hand to
        keep tension. Using medium scissors, cut approximately parallel
        to the skull to detach the fur and skin from the skull and
        snout.

    d.  Repeat on the other side of the head.

5.  Grasp the end of the snout with forceps and use scissors to cut the
    sides of the mouth, releasing the lower jaw.

6.  Use heavy scissors to cut through the skull, just behind the eyes,
    releasing the snout.

7.  Place the snout in a tube of Tyrode's buffer on ice until ready to
    proceed with the fine dissection.

Fine Dissection and Plating

1.  Prepare the plate. Place the desired number of filters into the
    multiwell plate and fill the bottom compartment with cold Tyrode's
    buffer. Set this aside.

2.  Transfer snout from tube to a dish of new Tyrode's buffer under a
    dissecting microscope.

3.  Use forceps to gently remove the olfactory bulb and any of the rest
    of the brain from the cavity behind the eyes. Note: If you're having
    trouble grasping the sample with forceps, it can be helpful to
    remove the eyes and grasp the samples by the eye sockets. (images:
    before and after removing olfactory bulb and remaining brain)

4.  Scrape or wipe the thin membrane from the top of the snout. 

5.  Use microdissection scissors to trim off the tip of the snout. This
    should be soft and not require cutting through calcified bone. 

6.  Transfer snout to paper towels and use a razor blade to split the
    snout just to the right of the midline. (Note: if you're having
    trouble cutting through cleanly, make sure your paper towels are a
    few layers thick to provide cushion under the blade.)

7.  Discard the right half of the snout. (This half, as well as the left
    half that will be left at the end of the fine dissection contain
    turbinate epithelium which can be fixed and used for other staining
    procedures, but these are not the septum epithelium we'll be using
    for explants.)

8.  Return the left half of the snout to the dish of Tyrode's buffer,
    and position a glass slide such that its end is next to the sample
    while the other end rests on the edge of the dish, out of the
    buffer.

9.  Use forceps to gently lift any remaining turbinate epithelium way
    from the septum.

10. Grasp the sample with forceps in one hand. With the other hand, use
    small bone cutting shears or other sturdy scissors to break the
    nasal bone that sits to the right of the septum. Make two breaks:
    one right next to the frontal bone, making it easier to remove, and
    one about halfway to the tip of the snout, anterior to the boundary
    between calcified and soft part of the septum. Be careful not to
    damage the septum epithelium, which should be exposed. (If the right
    nasal bone stayed on the discarded right half of the snout, skip
    this step.) For helpful images, see informatics.jax.org, The Anatomy of the
    Laboratory Mouse. 

11. Remove the piece of the nasal bone between the two breaks you just
    made.

12. Grasp the skull so that the septum epithelium is facing up, where
    you can see it. Use microdissecting scissors to cut through the
    cartilaginous part of the septum and the epithelium that lines it,
    starting at the anterior edge and roughly following the border with
    the calcified part of the septum. This should be visible as a more
    opaque, white petal shape on the posterior part of the septum.

13. Gently slide fine forceps between the soft, epithelium layer and the
    underlying bone to see that they can be separated. Grasp the
    epithelium at the dorsal/anterior corner to avoid damaging most of
    the sample and peel the epithelium away from the septum. The side
    facing you is the apical, cilium side of the epithelium. Take note
    of which side this is (e.g. Is the cilium side on the same side of
    the forceps as your thumb or index finger?) because you'll want to
    keep this side up.

14. Drag the piece of the epithelium away from the snout and up onto the
    glass slide. Be sure you're keeping the cilium side up, leaving the
    basal side on the glass. Note that the hand not holding the
    epithelium will likely need to release the snout to move the
    dissection dish and position the glass slide in the field of view.
    As you drag the piece of epithelium up out of the buffer, a small
    droplet should come with it.

15. Remove the lid from the plate of filters.

16. Use forceps to lift the epithelium from the glass slide. Set it down
    on the filter, dragging it slightly to keep it straight. The
    epithelium often rolls up, cilium side out, at this point, so it
    might look more like a tube sitting on the filter.

17. Move the plate of filters under the dissection microscope and use a
    plastic pipette tip to gently prod the edges of the epithelium until
    it is flat. If the pipette tip is doing too much damage to the
    sample, or if the epithelium didn't roll up, skip this step.

18. Cover the plate of filters and set it aside again. Return the
    dissection dish to the dissection microscope.

19. Grasp the snout so that the bare side of the septum is facing you.
    Use bone shears to cut the left nasal bone, above the septum,
    mirroring the breaks made to remove the right nasal bone. 
20. Use forceps to remove the left nasal bone between the breaks.

21. Use microdissecting scissors to gently cut around the piece of
    calcified septum. This could require cutting along the dorsal edge
    (under where the nasal bone was), the posterior edge (against where
    the olfactory bulb use to be), and the ventral edge (near the roof
    of the mouth). Be careful not to damage the epithelium attached to
    the side of the septum that is facing the bottom of the dish.

22. Use forceps to lift out the calcified septum and attached
    epithelium. Again, this is best done from an edge or corner, rather
    than grasping across the epithelium and damaging the epithelium.

23. Flip the septum over and set it on the glass slide with the septum
    down and the cilium side up.

24. Use fine forceps to "pin" a corner or edge of the epithelium to the
    glass slide with one hand. Use forceps in the other hand to grasp
    the septum below the epithelium. Gently wiggle and slide the septum
    bone out from under the epithelium, leaving the epithelium flat and
    cilium side up on the glass slide.

25. Drag the epithelium up the glass slide so that a droplet of buffer
    comes with it.

26. Remove the lid from the plate of filters.

27. Use forceps to transfer the epithelium to a filter. Flatten it out
    with a pipette as was done with the other piece. Note that multiple
    pieces of epithelium can be plated together on larger filters, such
    as those for 12-well plates, as long as they aren't touching one
    another. To keep track of which sample is which, you can use a
    marker to keep track of the position of the filter within the well
    (in case it spins) and label the lid with which sample is which.

Culturing

1.  Take the plate of filters and explants to the tissue culture hood.

2.  Aspirate the Tyrode's buffer out from under the filters.

3.  Fill the bottom compartment of the well, under the filter, with
    media. This amount varies depending on the size of the filter. Do
    not add too much, as the excess media will slowly come up through
    the filter, and the air-liquid interface will be lost as the explant
    becomes submerged. When the bottom compartment is filled, the media
    should just wet the filter, and the explants may look like they're
    in a small droplet of media. If you're uncertain how much media
    should be added, come back and check after an hour and see if any
    media has seeped into the top compartment.

> Other notes about culturing:

a.  Explants seem to take about an hour to recover from being dissected
    and being in cold buffer. If a treatment will be applied, it may be
    best to allow explants to recover in regular EEM, remove the medium
    after an hour, and replace it with the treatment medium.

b.  Under the current conditions, samples start to have a few dead
    nuclei at 24 hours and many dense, dead nuclei by 48 hours. If
    attempting longer culturing times, media may need to be replaced
    each day to keep samples healthy and uncontaminated.

c.  Explants are typically fixed by using forceps to lift them off of
    the filter and transfer them into 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. They
    can be fixed at 4°C overnight.
